# Credibility Scoring: Technical Report (Brief)

## Objective
Summarize the algorithmic approach and research behind the credibility scoring system. Provide a concise roadmap for future improvements.

## Algorithm & Rationale
- Combines ML (BERT-based fake news classifier) and rule-based heuristics.
- Features: domain authority, citation count, fact-check sources, content quality.
- Scoring: Weighted sum of component scores (credibility, fact check, citations).
- Decision thresholds: Scores mapped to tranches (Poorâ€“Excellent).
- Complexity: Fast enough for real-time use; scalable to large datasets.

## Literature Review (Summary)
- ML models (BERT, RoBERTa) outperform simple heuristics for credibility detection.
- Rule-based systems offer transparency but miss subtle patterns.
- Hybrid approaches (ML + rules) balance accuracy and interpretability.

## Methodology Justification
- ML used for nuanced content analysis; rules for domain/citation checks.
- Hybrid model improves accuracy over either alone.
- Trade-offs: ML is less interpretable, rules are less flexible.

## Parameters (Documentation)
- Input: URL (string)
- Output: JSON with scores and explanations
- Parameters: model weights, thresholds, feature toggles
- Future: Add more features, retrain ML, tune weights, improve error handling

## Maintenance Guidelines
- Update authoritative source lists and retrain ML model as new data emerges.
- Document changes and scoring logic for reproducibility.
